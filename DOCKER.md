# Docker for streamlit_prophet

## Installation

To create the Docker images you need to have installed Docker and run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Info

For the purpose of this repository two services are included into the docker-compose.yml
This means that two corresponding dockerfiles exist. One for the API service and one for the 
Streamlit one.

In the end two docker images are being built, one for each service.
