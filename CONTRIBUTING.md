## Dependencies

We use `venv` to manage the [dependencies](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
In order to run the needed scripts you need to have python installed and run the command below.

To activate your `venv` run `source "env_name"/bin/activate`.

To install dependencies run the command:

## Code style

Black is already into the dependencies (requirements.txt)
