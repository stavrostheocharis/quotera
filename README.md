## Requirements
### Python version
* Main supported version : <strong>3.9</strong> <br>
* Other supported versions : <strong>3.7</strong> & <strong>3.8</strong>

To use the scripts on your computer, please make sure you have one of these versions installed.

### Install environment & dependencies

In order to run the needed scripts you need to have python installed and run the command below.
```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

To activate your `venv` run `source "env_name"/bin/activate`.

To install dependencies run the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also for the parrot library run the command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Parrot_Paraphraser.git
```
### Paraphrase models

This implementation has taken into consideration AI models coming from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (specifically the "prithivida/parrot_paraphraser_on_T5" in combination with the [Parrot_Paraphraser](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Parrot_Paraphraser) package, but you can use other variations too). In order to run everything, an account and a token from Hugging Face are mandatory. In order to get everything ready, please read this [guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens).

Once you have a token from Hugging Face, create a token.txt file in your quotera folder and paste it inside your token (it will automatically be used by the app).

### How to use it

As stated there are 2 ways. You can use the Streamlit app, or the API.

Once installed the dependencies
- run the following command from CLI to open the app in the default web browser:

    ```
    python quotera_streamlit_cli.py 
    ```
- run the following command from CLI to open the API in the default web browser:

    ```
    python quotera_cli.py serve
    ```
